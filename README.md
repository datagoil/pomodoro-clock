Odin Project Assignment
I decided to try this one on my own though it was to be the first pairing project.
Visually, this project looks similar to the example. I didn't branch out on the styling.
I added pop-up notifications when the session/breaks reach zero minutes. 
Additionally, the screen blinks and a short audio prompt is given at the end of each session/break. The functionality is good.
